Script to monitor soil wetness and air temperature & humidity

## Overview
This script is for monitoring the soil wetness of one or more plants, as well as the air temperature & humidity. 

## Hardware Requirements
### Mandatory
- Raspberry Pi 
    I run Raspbian on a Model B3
- Soil Wetness Sensor
    Commonly referred to as YL-69 sensors
    I used these https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071F4RDHY/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_wsdACbNXHW42N
- MCP3008
    Used as DAQ to read analog sensor voltage
    I got mine here https://www.adafruit.com/product/856

### Optional
- Wi-Fi Temperature & Humidity Sensor
    Provides additional environment context
    My personal favorite http://projects.privateeyepi.com/WIFI-Sensor
- Enclosure for YL-69 circuit board
